1. Include required libraries.

2. Define the receiver's ESP32 address.

3. Create an ADXL345 object to communicate with the accelerometer.

4. Define a structure for the data to send:
    - Variables `x` and `y` for acceleration measurements along the X and Y axes.

5. Create a global variable to hold the data to send.

6. Define a variable to store receiver information:
    - Use `esp_now_peer_info_t` to hold the receiver's address and communication details.

7. Setup function:
    - Initialize the ADXL345 accelerometer.
    - Initialize Wi-Fi in station mode for ESP-NOW communication.
    - Initialize ESP-NOW communication.
    - Copy the receiver's address into the receiver information structure.
    - Establish a connection with the receiver using ESP-NOW.

8. Loop function:
    - Create a variable to store sensor data (`event`).
    - Retrieve acceleration data from the ADXL345 and store it in `event`.
    - Assign the X-axis and Y-axis acceleration data to the sending message structure.
    - Send the prepared data to the receiver using ESP-NOW.
